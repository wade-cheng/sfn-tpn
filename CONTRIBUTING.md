This is as much a reminder to myself as to other people :p

1. Do all work on dev branch.
   - If you're helping out, send pull requests there! Thank you <3
1. When ready to merge, merge into main.
1. `cargo release <level>` to dry run. Follow instructions for the real run.
   - This runs `cargo publish` to <https://crates.io>.
1. `git merge main && git push` from dev to fast-forward it on track.
1. Go to step 1.
