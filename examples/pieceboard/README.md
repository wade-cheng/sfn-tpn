# pieceboard

A bunch of pieces on a board.

Run this example with

```
cargo run --example pieceboard server
```

Follow instructions to run the client. The client can be anywhere in the world, from localhost to a friend's house behind a NAT firewall, as long as it can be connected over the internet to the server.

The client has the first move. The client and server alternate moving pieces. Click to select a piece, and click elsewhere to move.
